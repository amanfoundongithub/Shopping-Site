# Shopping Site Project
Project has been made using `React.js` 

## Development Ideas :
- The project was developed using ReactJS , an open source JS library designed by Facebook. 
- The database that has been used to store data is `Google Firebase` since its API was easier to use. The initial motivation was to use `MongoDB` but it had a very poor API experience. 
- The CSS part has been handled for the most cases by the `Bootstrap CSS` available online. 

## Functionalities Offered : 
- The functionalities that are offered in the project are as follows:
    - A `Sign In` page to sign in to the system using Email and Password of the user. The authorization has been done by using `Google Firebase Authorization API`. 
    - A `Sign Up` page for first time users to create an account. The account has been created and is updated using a Realtime Database System by the Firebase.
    - A `View Cart` functionality to view the products that have been added to the Cart. 
    - A `View Orders` functionality to view the products that have been ordered by the person. 
    - Each product has an ID associated to it and can be added to the cart or placed order. 

## Running On localhost : 
- Go to the same directory where the project lies and type :
```
>>> npm install
```
then 
```
>>> npm start
``` 
- It will then run on localhost
